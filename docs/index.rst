Meta Template documentation
===========================

A tool that helps **template creators** to create **software templates** for research software, and adopt best practices on sustainable software for Natural and Engineering Sciences. It provides a way to align best practices and reduce maintainance efforts across organisations, while allowing organisation to customize software templates to their needs. 

Research organisations want to produce high-quality research software by adopting common best practices, but we have to acknowledge that every organisation has practices and workflows that are only important to them. Therefore, we facilitate adopting common best practices for research software development through a highly customisable tool that allows organisations to create their own software templates, while aligning with the best practices of the Natural and Engineering Sciences community in the Netherlands.

A template to initialize templating projects that comply with best practices on sustainable software in Natural and Engineering Science. This template contains boilerplate for developing custom research software templates using `copier <https://copier.readthedocs.io>`_.
